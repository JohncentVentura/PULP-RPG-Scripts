# PULP RPG Scripts
Project of University of Luzon Pozorrubio Role Playing Game or “PULP RPG” is a free and educational game for Windows 10 that is exclusive for both campuses that aids the declining enrollment number of students at the Pozorrubio Satellite Campus.

* Using Inky (A Narrative Scripting Language) for creating a Dialogue System.
* Enjoyed level designing to challenge players.
* Created pixel art style graphics with animations.
